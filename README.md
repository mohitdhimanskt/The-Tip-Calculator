PROJECT: The Tip Calculator

    Every week ends with a project you have to build on your own. Instead of getting clear-cut instructions, you'll get a list of criteria that your project needs to measure up to.

    Important! Place your code in the folder Week3 \ project.

In this week's project you'll be making a Tip Calculator! A user can fill in 3 things:

    The amount of the bill
    How good the service was
    How many people will share the bill

When the button is clicked a calculation is made and the user can read the tip amount underneath.

It should look like this:

The Tip Calculator

Here are the requirements:

    No frameworks allowed
    Use a form, that has 3 input fields (the first and last can only take numbers)
    The second field should have the following options:

Service Quality

    If there's only 1 person who shares the bill, output only the tip amount (omit the "each")
    If any of the input fields are empty when the button is clicked, call an alert that says: "You need to fill in all the fields!"
